# Angular 7 Real World implementation 

This project is an Angular implementations of the Thinkster 'Real World' front end 'Conduit' which is a Medium clone.

The project is hosted here - https://mattr.z19.web.core.windows.net

The project is Angular style guide and best practice compliant and, as far as I can see, correctly implements the functionality of the 'Conduit' front end.

Although building Conduit doesn't quite require you to exercise the vast totality of Angular functionality, it does need most of the key features you need to understand to build a production Angular application including,

1. Reusable components
2. Routing included child routes, route guards 
3. Observables for HTTP and state sharing
4. Authentication (as in basic token auth)
5. Custom directives 
6. Project layout and structure with Angular CLI
7. Some basic unit testing 

## Running and Building the Project 

Project uses the (awesome) Angular CLI for build.

1. Install the Angular CLI globally. 
2. Run npm install to resolve all dependencies. 
3. Run ng serve 
4. In a browser navigate to http://localhost:4200/
